# Welcome


I am Joakim Stenmark, a Game programming student at Yrgo gothenburg! 
Currently working on *Vampire Nights*, a school project at Yrgo, as a game design lead and programmer. <br>

## What I'm working on
I have a background in audio and music so i'm naturally drawn to programming tasks related to that. In Vampire Nights I made an Audio Manager following the singleton pattern. [Link to AudioManager](https://github.com/NicklasHidesjo/GameProjectTwo/blob/main/GameProjectTwo/Assets/Audio/AudioScripts/AudioManager.cs)

This way whenever I want a sound to play in the games code I can type 
```cs
  AudioManager.instance.PlaySound(SoundType.EnumOfSound); 
```

It even works for sounds that should play spatilized to a location by including the gameobject that plays the sound as a parameter. This makes it easy to handle most of this games audio needs without repeating code and all the audiofile references can be centralized to one place.


## Game Portfolio

### Misfortunate Tadpole | School project at Yrgo - Gothenburg
Nov 2020 â€“ Jan 2021 <br>
Cute 2D platformer made in Unity where you control with only one button. <br>
On this project I worked as a Project Lead, coming up with tasks and coordinating them for the team. <br>
As a programmer, I coded the player character, the audio system, and made a parallax moving background among many other features. <br>
I also created all the sound and music for the game and made the trailer. <br>

### Physics Gun Testing Facility | School project at Yrgo - Gothenburg
Mar 2021 â€“ Apr 2021
First person puzzle game made in Unreal 4. <br>
I worked as solo developer on this one, relying only on unreals templates and what free graphical assets i could find. The Scripting, level design, audio and music design are all done by me. In this project i also learned alot about materials and how to modify them. <br>
