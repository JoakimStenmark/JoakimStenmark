## Game Portfolio

### Vampire Nights | School project at Yrgo - Gothenburg
##### Apr 2021 - Maj 2021 <br>
#### Stealth game about sucking blood and staying alive
On this project I worked as a Game design lead as well as a programmer. My programming work involved creating interactivity between the player character and objects in the world, allowing the player to suck blood from NPCs, carry dead bodies, and hide in barrels. Once again I did all the sound, music and its implementation.

### Misfortunate Tadpole | School project at Yrgo - Gothenburg
##### Nov 2020 â€“ Jan 2021 <br>
#### Cute 2D platformer made in Unity where you control with only one button. <br>
On this project I worked as a Project Lead, coming up with tasks and coordinating them for the team. <br>
As a programmer, I coded the player character, the audio system, and made a parallax moving background among many other features. <br>
I also created all the sound and music for the game and made the trailer. <br>

##### Mar 2021 â€“ Apr 2021 <br>
#### First person puzzle game made in Unreal 4. <br>
I worked as solo developer on this one, relying only on unreals templates and what free graphical assets i could find. The Scripting, level design, audio and music design are all done by me. In this project i also learned alot about materials and how to modify them. <br>
