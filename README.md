## Game Portfolio

### Misfortunate Tadpole | School project at Yrgo - Gothenburg
Nov 2020 â€“ Jan 2021 <br>
Cute 2D platformer made in Unity where you control with only one button. <br>
On this project I worked as a Project Lead, coming up with tasks and coordinating them for the team. <br>
As a programmer, I coded the player character, the audio system, and made a parallax moving background among many other features. <br>
I also created all the sound and music for the game and made the trailer. <br>
Full game available on [Itch.Io](https://yrgo-game-creator.itch.io/misfortunate-tadpole) <br>

### Physics Gun Testing Facility | School project at Yrgo - Gothenburg
Mar 2021 â€“ Apr 2021
First person puzzle game made in Unreal 4. <br>
I worked as solo developer on this one, relying only on unreals templates and what free graphical assets i could find. The Scripting, level design, audio and music design are all done by me. In this project i also learned alot about materials and how to modify them.
